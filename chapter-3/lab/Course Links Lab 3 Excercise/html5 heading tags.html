        <h4>Java For Beginners: Writing Your First Program</h4>
        
        <p>Welcome. If this is your first time programming, congratulations! You're about to start an adventure that most find very rewarding. If you are trying to learn after a previous abortive attempt, you deserve recognition as well. Tackling programming isn't always easy--but it is not outside the grasp of the average person either.</p>
        
        <p>Over the years, I've taught programming to over 500,000 people, both online and in person. The programmer's I've met over the years--both beginners and seasoned veterans--have come from a variety of backgrounds. I've found that both PhDs and high school dropouts can make good programmers. I've had mathematicians, psychiatrists, and 12 year-olds in my classes over the years and all have been able to learn some programming.</p>
        
        <p>You will learn too. In this introductory chapter, which is specifically designed for the slightly apprehensive beginner, I am going to take you step-by-step through the process of writing your first program. You don't need any special equipment except a laptop or desktop computer.</p>
        
        <p>So without further delay, let's get started.</p>
